	\begin{itemize}
		\item \NameUrlTextBlock
		{FPGA-Based Color-Tracking Robot (Verilog, PicoBlaze)}{http://tinyurl.com/color-fpga-bot}
		{I worked with a partner to design and built an autonomous color-seeking robot for the final project in an SoC with FPGAs course.  The robot was controlled with a combination of custom Verilog code and a Picoblaze soft-core microcontroller instantiated inside the FPGA on a Spartan-6E development board.  This robot used a CMUCam4 camera for vision and several proximity sensors for environmental awareness.  It could be trained to any color, which it would then seek out and follow. 
In a classwide competition, this design was awarded 1$^{st}$ place for best term project by the instructors.}
 
		\item \NameUrlTextBlock
		{Branch Predictor/BTB simulation (C)}	{https://github.com/rattboi/flanders_ece486}
		{I worked with a partner to develop a branch predictor and branch target buffer simulation as a final project in a Computer Architecture course.   Our algorithm was tested against numerous traces from an unknown processor and obtained the 3$^{rd}$ best performance in the class.}
		
		\item \NameUrlTextBlock
		{Microprocessor Cache Simulation (Verilog)}{https://github.com/ekrause/0xBEEFA55}
		{I developed a split-level L1 cache simulator with a small team for the final project of a Microprocessor Design course. It read in a text file of sample trace data, and displayed cache hit/miss statistics at completion of the trace.  We were later contacted by the professor and our source code was incorporated into the course material.}
