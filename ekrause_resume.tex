\header{Academic Projects}

\textbf{FPGA-Based Color-Tracking Robot (Verilog, PicoBlaze) \hfill \url{http://tinyurl.com/color-fpga-bot}}\\
I worked with a partner to design and built an autonomous color-seeking robot for the final project in an SoC with FPGAs course.  The robot was controlled using a Picoblaze soft-core microcontroller instantiated in the FPGA on a Spartan-6E development board, and used a CMUCam4 for vision, as well as other sensors for environmental awareness.  It could be trained to any color, which it would then seek out and follow.\\\vspace{3pt}
In classwide competition, this design was awarded 1$^{st}$ place for best  term project by the instructors.

\textbf{Branch Predictor/BTB simulation (C) \hfill \url{https://github.com/rattboi/flanders_ece486}}\\
I worked with a partner to develop a branch predictor and branch target buffer simulation as a final project in a Computer Architecture course.   Our algorithm was tested against numerous traces from an unknown processor and obtained the 3$^{rd}$ best performance in the class.\\

\vspace{3pt}

\textbf{Microprocessor Cache Simulation (Verilog) \hfill \url{https://github.com/ekrause/0xBEEFA55}}\\
I developed a split-level L1 cache simulator with a small team for the final of a Microprocessor Design course. It read in textﬁle sample trace data, and displayed cache hit/miss statistics.  We were later contacted by the processor and our source code was incorporated into the course material.
